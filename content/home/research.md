{{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
This study shows that changes in sentiment inequality, defined as the consumer sentiment difference between high- and low-income groups, can predict the future performance of high-end compared with low-end product firms. Strategies that combine the use of sentiment inequality changes with firms' cash-flow cyclicality (betas) to assess firms' product position on the low- to high-end spectrum generate abnormal risk-adjusted returns. As a case study, we provide evidence of how changes in sentiment inequality predict the relative performance of fast-food versus casual dining firms. Finally, this study shows that an increase in sentiment inequality is a positive predictor of market returns.
