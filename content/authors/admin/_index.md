Welcome!

I am Husna Memon, a Finance Ph.D. candidate  at Simon Fraser University.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
My work is in empirical corporate finance through the lenses of consumption inequality, income inequality, and gender diversity.  My recent research studies how the disaggregation of consumer sentiment across income groups can be used to forecast cashflows and returns in the cross-section of firms, as well as to predict future market changes.
