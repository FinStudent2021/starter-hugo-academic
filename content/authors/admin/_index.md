Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the University of British Columbia, Sauder School of Business.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
My research interests include corporate finance, entrepreneurship, and labor economics. Currently, I research the effect of corporate ownership structure on workers and the determinants of entrepreneurial entry and success. I am especially interested in understanding what causes the persistent gender gap in entrepreneurship.

Welcome!

I am Husna Memon, a Finance Ph.D. candidate  at Simon Fraser University.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
My work is in empirical corporate finance through the lenses of consumption inequality, income inequality, and gender diversity.  My recent research studies how the disaggregation of consumer sentiment across income groups can be used to forecast cashflows and returns in the cross-section of firms, as well as to predict future market changes.
